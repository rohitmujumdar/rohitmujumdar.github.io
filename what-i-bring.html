            <h1>What I Bring to the Table</h1>
            <h3>Diverse Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>I've thrived in environments from a 4-employee startup in India to Intel, and from academic research at Georgia Tech to IBM Research. This diversity has honed my adaptability and ability to deliver results in varied settings.</p>

            <h3>Comfort with Ambiguity</h3>
            <p>In my current role, I've navigated research uncertainties, funding challenges, layoffs, and evolving business needs. This experience has strengthened my ability to adapt and innovate in ambiguous situations.</p>

            <h3>Collaborative Spirit</h3>
            <p>I thrive on collaboration, believing that diverse teams create the best results. For instance, I collaborated with a sociology professor from the University of Budapest on prompts to analyze LLMs' queer value systems. My communication skills, empathy, and discipline make me an asset to globally distributed teams like Hugging Face.</p>

            <h3>Ownership and Proactivity</h3>
            <p>I take full ownership of projects and proactively seek opportunities. At Intel, I identified use cases for my skills outside my team and learned new technologies to deliver a RAG solution for internal document interaction.</p>

            <h3>Human-Centric Approach to Technology</h3>
            <p>As a queer, first-generation immigrant, I understand technology's societal impact. This perspective, deepened through podcast interviews and my role as Head TA for Georgia Tech's AI ethics course, informs my work to benefit underrepresented communities.</p>

            <h3>Open Source and AI for Social Good</h3>
            <p>I support democratizing good ML and open source. I developed HawkEye, a reputation system for Twitter's Birdwatch (now Community Notes), to combat misinformation. Our project was possible because Twitter open-sourced Birdwatch's data and code. Recognizing the power of open source, we also open-sourced HawkEye, influencing improvements to Twitter's Community Notes algorithm.</p>
