            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a passionate and results-driven computer scientist with experience in machine learning, data science, and software engineering. With a Master's degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech and extensive experience working with leading technology companies like Intel, NCR Corporation, and IBM Research, I specialize in developing innovative solutions that drive business success. As a queer, first-generation immigrant, I bring a unique perspective to my work, combining technical expertise with a human-centric approach to technology.</p>

            <h1>What I Bring to the Table</h1>
            <h3>üåü Diverse Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>I've thrived in environments from a 4-employee startup in India to Intel, and from academic research at Georgia Tech to IBM Research. This diversity has honed my adaptability and ability to deliver results in varied settings.</p>
            <h3>üîÑ Comfort with Ambiguity</h3>
            <p>In my current role, I've navigated research uncertainties, funding challenges, layoffs, and evolving business needs. This experience has strengthened my ability to adapt and innovate in ambiguous situations.</p>
            <h3>ü§ù Collaborative Spirit</h3>
            <p>I thrive on collaboration, believing that diverse teams create the best results. For instance, I collaborated with a sociology professor from the University of Budapest on prompts to analyze LLMs' queer value systems. My communication skills, empathy, and discipline make me an asset to globally distributed teams like Hugging Face.</p>
            <h3>üöÄ Ownership and Proactivity</h3>
            <p>I take full ownership of projects and proactively seek opportunities. At Intel, I identified use cases for my skills outside my team and learned new technologies to deliver a RAG solution for internal document interaction.</p>
            <h3>üåç Human-Centric Approach to Technology</h3>
            <p>As a queer, first-generation immigrant, I understand technology's societal impact. This perspective, deepened through podcast interviews and my role as Head TA for Georgia Tech's AI ethics course, informs my work to benefit underrepresented communities.</p>
            <h3>üîì Open Source and AI for Social Good</h3>
            <p>I support democratizing good ML and open source. I developed HawkEye, a reputation system for Twitter's Birdwatch (now Community Notes), to combat misinformation. Our project was possible because Twitter open-sourced Birdwatch's data and code. Recognizing the power of open source, we also open-sourced HawkEye, influencing improvements to Twitter's Community Notes algorithm.</p>
        </section>

            <h1>Highlights</h1>
            <p>üî¨ I collaborated with <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~skumar498/">Prof. Srijan Kumar</a> to develop <i>HawkEye</i>, a reputation system for <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en">Birdwatch</a> (now called Community Notes), Twitter‚Äôs community-driven feature to address misinformation, which was the first research study on Birdwatch and was successful in <a href="https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/about/ranking-notes/"><b>influencing</b></a> the Birdwatch platform. Our <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/pubs/hawkeye-asonam21.pdf">paper</a> based on this work got <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6864375201623277568/"><b>published</b></a> in <a href="https://asonam.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/2021/dates.php">ASONAM'21</a>.</p>
            <p>üöÄ I interned with the <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=9465">Cloud Services Design Analytics</a> group at <a href="https://www.draco.res.ibm.com/">IBM Research</a>.

            <p>üçã Prior to commencing my MS degree in Fall 2019, I worked as a Data Scientist (NLP) at <a href="https://froot.co.in/">Froot Research</a> (now acquired by Aarav Solutions). As one of the first few employees of an early-stage AI start-up, I was mentored by the founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amit-gautam-0b6356a1/">Amit Gautam</a>.</p>
            <p>üßë‚Äçüéì I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in 2017 from <a href="http://www.vit.edu/">Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/manasi-patwardhan-25215019">Dr. Manasi Patwardhan</a>.</p>
            <p>üé• I run a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC85aF1GbDkl9-tzwanPMhXA/videos">video podcast, 'Talking To The Moon'</a>, where I interview people across professions and walks of life and listen to the stories they have to tell.

            <h3>Recognizing Similar Relationships Within Ontology to Fine Tune Ontology</h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neelam Chandolikar, Rishav Raj, Rohit Mujumdar</p>
            <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> knowledge graphs, natural language processing, semantic search engine, ontology learning, triplet extraction, education technology</p>
            <p><strong>Conference:</strong> ICDMAI</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Ontology learning process involves identification of concepts and the relationships between these concepts. Automated ontology learning based on ML/DL techniques identifies these triples but suffers from the problem of duplicate or similar relationships. We propose a solution to identify similar relationships so that the ontology can be fine-tuned.</p>

            <h3>Overcoming Language Disparity in Online Content Classification with Multimodal Learning</h3>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaurav Verma, Rohit Mujumdar, Zijie J. Wang, Munmun De Choudhury, Srijan Kumar</p>
            <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> social media, multimodal language models, language disparity, language translation</p>
            <p><strong>Conference:</strong> ICWSM 2022</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We investigate the disparity between English and non-English language models and show that detection frameworks based on pre-trained large language models like BERT and multilingual-BERT systematically perform better on the English language. We demonstrate the promise of incorporating the information contained in images via multimodal machine learning to address this disparity.</p>

            <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> social network analysis, misinformation, graph algorithms, adversarial attack</p>
            <p><strong>Conference:</strong> ASONAM 2021</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We investigate the robustness of Birdwatch against adversaries and show that the current Birdwatch system is vulnerable to manipulation attacks. To overcome this vulnerability, we develop HawkEye, a cold-start-aware graph-based recursive algorithm, and show that it is more robust to such attacks.</p>
